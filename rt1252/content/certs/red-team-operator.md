### Background Info {#background-info}

I received OSCP about 9 months ago and have not taken an offensive certification since. I joined my employers pentest team recently and noticed that I have lots to learn, especially around red teaming. 

The course materials are nothing short of exceptional, this certificate includes many attacks which I had heard of but did not fully understand. Topics include Cobalt Strike, Lateral Movement, Kerberos, SQL Server, Domain Dominance, Forest/Domain Trusts, Defense Evasion, and more. Each topic includes labs which give you hands on experience and really help you understand each technique.

The course and exam were newly revised to give you unlimited lab launches and unlimited exam attempts. The exam changed from submitting flags to a single objective that must be achieved while maintaining OPSEC.

### Study Materials {#study-materials}

The only study materials needed are included in the course training and cover everything you could need. I recommend taking extensive notes that you can quickly reference during the exam.

### Exam Experience {#exam-experience}

The exam is on-demand and gives you 48 hours of lab time, the timer only runs when the lab is active, you can pause it at any time. The first attempt I got about 70% through the attack path and then ran into a brick wall. The second attempt I was able to achieve the objective - finishing the attack path, but I failed by 2 points due to OPSEC. Finally, on my third attempt I finished in under and hour because I already knew the attack path and understood the OPSEC techniques I needed.

### Exam Review {#exam-review}

I highly recommend this course and exam for anyone looking to learn more about red teaming. The course materials and exam experience is nothing short of exceptional. CRTL (AKA CRTO II) is currently in the process of being revised, once it is released I will certainly be purchasing the materials.
