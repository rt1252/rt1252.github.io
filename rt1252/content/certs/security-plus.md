### Exam Experience {#exam-experience}

The exam was pretty straightforward, I went in person to the testing center. I would always recommend doing this as the online proctors can be annoying to deal with. I was well prepared following the study schedule and was able to pass first attempt.

### Exam Review {#exam-review}

No complaints with this exam as it does open doors up for internships and entry level positions. The price is a bit steep for being a multiple choice exam, but it is what it is.
