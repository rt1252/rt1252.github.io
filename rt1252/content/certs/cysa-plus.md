### Background Info {#background-info}

This was my second CompTIA exam, this exam was taken at the start of my senior year in university. After a few SOC interships I thought it would be good to get a SOC specific certificate. Looking back taking BTL1 might have been a better hands on certificate.

### Study Materials {#study-materials}

- [My study schedule](https://jade-drop-513.notion.site/CySA-5e1291988607436a986eebca005edc62), make a copy of the notion site!
- [Sybex CySA+ Study Guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-CySA-Study-Guide-CS0-002/dp/1119684056), the study guide includes access to the Wiley testbank which was super valuable.

### Exam Experience {#exam-experience}

Once again another in person testing center exam, the exam this time was not as smooth. The exam kept crashing and I ended up taking a 30 minute nap in the testing center as they troubleshooted the issues. Other than the technical difficulties this exam was a lot more fun than Security+ since it had Performance Based Questions (PBQs). The PBQs were simple drag and drop exercises, but broke up the monotony of multiple choice questions.

### Exam Review {#exam-review}

This exam is good for showing some additional interest in being a SOC analyst but does not carry much weight. It is mostly an exam testing your terminology of topics, not your ability to actual be a SOC analyst.
