### Background Info {#background-info}

Having previously started my pentesting journey 15 months ago starting with eJPT; OSCP was a cert that I had on my radar for a long time.

Having about a full gap year between graduating undergrad and starting work, I decided this would be a good time to grind out this certification, as studying every day after work sounds exhausting.

My reasoning for this exam was mainly to get on pentesting engagements with my future employer and also for future job security.

### Study Materials {#study-materials}

PJPT & PNPT turned out to be very good AD experience which was certainly helpful for the exam.

My main way of practicing machines was [Lainkusanagi OSCP Like list of practice machines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18weuz_Eeynr6sXFQ87Cd5F0slOj9Z6rt/edit?gid=487240997#gid=487240997); I completed HTB, THM, & PG machines. Warning: the sheet contains spoilers — [view my copy here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XozpbDD511VevdUfauNfBcukAr9wWpmi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116720602911468126819&rtpof=true&sd=true).

After purchasing the exam material, I at best skimmed through the important sections doing the occasional lab while skipping some sections entirely. HTB Academy provided much better training material for a fraction of the cost. I recommend HTB Academy modules: AD attacker & enumeration, Linux privilege escalation, and Windows privilege escalation.

I enjoyed [Hack the Clown's GOAD Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL08nYpWQJ_zM4JxekcckBVjglpVWgg2u0&si=IVGdr8Vx9DgO6zsB) and [Derron C's AD playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT08J44ErMmb9qaEeTYl5diQW6jWVHCR2&si=_WUtYPDNh95x9LzN) for supplemental video content.

I treated the OSCP-A,B,C challenge exams as if they were the actual exam, keeping track of my score and running the clock. The standalone machines were great practice; my main complaint was that some practice sets repeated the same scenario across multiple challenges.

Tools I recommend learning are ligolo & penelope; more important is learning to manually spot irregularities and anomalies.

### Exam Experience {#exam-experience}

I can't discuss exam specifics, but I found the AD set easy with the assumed-breach scenario and finished in ~3–4 hours.

One standalone was easy, one was much harder than expected, and another had no initial foothold.

Total score was 80/100. I was relieved to pass on the first attempt.

### Exam Review {#exam-review}

My biggest complaint was reuse of content across practice sets. That said, passing the exam was a huge relief and I'm hopeful it will open doors.
