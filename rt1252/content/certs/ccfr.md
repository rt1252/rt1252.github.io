### Background Info {#background-info}

During my time working on a SOC team my first 6 months of full-time employment, I decided to get another credential to supplement my feedback cycle. My SOC team used CrowdStrike for investigating alerts and I had become familiar investigating alerts on the platform.

The training and certification were covered due to my employer having an aliance with CrowdStrike. I do not think I would have paid for this certificate out of pocket, it does not hold weight in industry. 

### Study Materials {#study-materials}

The materials from the CCFR path in CrowdStrike University were enough to pass the exam.

### Exam Experience {#exam-experience}

The exam was pretty easy and the training material covered a lot of the exam material. The stuff that was not covered was common knowledge for those who use CS.

### Exam Review {#exam-review}
