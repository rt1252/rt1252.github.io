### Background Info {#background-info}

This is the second TCM Security exam that I have taken; I passed PJPT a few months before taking this test.

This exam is a five-day practical exam with two more days for reporting.

### Study Materials {#study-materials}

Do not bother studying anything on this exam other than the PEH course — absolutely nothing else is required.

You need to fully understand topics from the course including finding external attack vectors, pivoting, and AD attacks.

### Exam Experience {#exam-experience}

This is pretty embarrassing — I failed twice at the same point because of lack of attention to detail.

Exam experience was smooth with no VPN or connection issues; support exists but may not be helpful. If you do a full reset expect to wait 10–20 minutes for services to come back online.

### Exam Review {#exam-review}

Very good foundational content for learning AD attacks; I would highly recommend the course and exam at this price point.

The exam report portion can be annoying to format in Word, but producing a sufficiently detailed report is an important skill.
