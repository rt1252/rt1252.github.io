### Background Info {#background-info}

This is THM's first exam which simulates a SOC analyst's responsibilities.

The exam consists of 80 multiple choice, then two SOC simulations each two hours long.

### Study Materials {#study-materials}

Already holding CompTIA certifications similar to this such as CySA+, I put only around 3 hours of studying before taking the test.

I would recommend doing the Splunk modules from the recommended learning path if you have never used Splunk or need a quick refresher.

Additionally, use the SOC simulator and do the Phishing Unfolded challenge to get experience using the simulator and see how the AI wants your case reports to look.

### Exam Experience {#exam-experience}

The multiple choice section can be completed quickly; the SOC simulator allows opening multiple tabs which is helpful.

If you have SOC experience you'll find the alerts easier, but be thorough in your reporting — the AI grader looks for detail (5Ws, evidence from Splunk, and overall context).

Only TP case reports are graded; mark FPs as FP so you don't waste time writing reports for false positives.

### Exam Review {#exam-review}

Overall the exam was smooth and I enjoyed investigating alerts in Splunk. This was a good SOC exam that actual tested your ability to investigate alerts unlike CySA+.

My main critique is uncertainty around how the AI grader works; sometimes I copied parts of previous reports because I wasn't sure if the grader would correlate them.
