Welcome — this is the About page. Replace this text with a short biography, what the site is about, contact information, or links to social profiles.

You can add images by placing them in `static/images/` and referencing them here, for example:

![Photo of me](/images/about-photo.jpg)

If you'd like a custom layout for the About page, we can create `layouts/_default/single.html` or a theme override at `themes/LoveIt/layouts/`.

Small note: this page is created to work out-of-the-box with the LoveIt theme.
