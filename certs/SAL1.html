  <h2 id="background-info" style="margin-left: 15px;">Background Info</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">This is THM's first exam which simulates a SOC analyst's responsibilities.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">The exam consists of 80 multiple choice, then two soc simulations each two hours long.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">The exam is advertised to be beginner friendly & only time will tell if it holds any value in the industry, <br> unsurprisingly there are no jobs mentioning the certification on Indeed yet.</p>

  <h2 id="study-materials" style="margin-left: 15px;">Study Materials</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">Already holding CompTIA certifications similar to this such as CySA+ I put only around 3 hours of studying before taking the test.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I would recommend doing the Splunk modules from the recommended learning path if you have never used Splunk or need a quick refresher like myself.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">Additionally, use the SOC simulator and do the Phishing Unfolded challenge to get experience using the simulator <br>and see how the AI wants your case reports to look like.</p>


  <h2 id="exam-experience" style="margin-left: 15px;">Exam Experience</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">First section was the multiple choice which I blew through in about half of the alloted time, these are questions like you would see on Security+ or CySA+.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">The SOC simulator was great, you can open multiple tabs in the environment which I found to be very helpful.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I have had previous experience working in a SOC so I found the alerts to be pretty easy but make sure to be very thorough in your reports.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">The AI grader is looking for lots of detail including the 5Ws, any other evidence that you can mention from Splunk, and the overall big picture of why this alert matters.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">Only the TP case reports are graded so if you have a FP just mark as FP and write FP in the case report, you will not have time to write reports for false positives.</p>


  <h2 id="exam-review" style="margin-left: 15px;">Exam Review</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">Overall the exam experience as a whole was very smooth and I did enjoy investigating the alerts in Splunk.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">My main critique would be not knowing exactly how the AI works, if one alert was correlated with another I found myself mentioning the correlated alert ID, <br> but then would also just copy and paste parts of the previous report because I was unsure if the AI would be smart enough to go back and read the other report that I had mentioned.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I am glad that the exam does allow for breaks between sections, in the SOC sections I found myself taking up most of the two hours to ensure that I had more than enough detail.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I would say this exam is better for analysts looking to break into the field rather than CySA+ (I cannot speak to BTL1 as I have not completed it), but <br>it will take time to see if this certification actually holds any value in the industry.</p>
