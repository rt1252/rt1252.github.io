  <h2 id="background-info" style="margin-left: 15px;">Background Info</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">Having previously started my pentesting journey 15 months ago starting with eJPT; OSCP was a cert that I had on my radar for a long time.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">Having about a full gap year between graduating undergrad and starting work, I decided this would be a good time to grind out this certification, as studying every day after work sounds exhausting.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">My reasoning for this exam was mainly to get on pentesting engagements with my future employer and also for future job security.</p>


  <h2 id="study-materials" style="margin-left: 15px;">Study Materials</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">PJPT & PNPT turned out to be very good AD experience which was certainly helpful for the exam.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">My main way of practicing machines was <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18weuz_Eeynr6sXFQ87Cd5F0slOj9Z6rt/edit?gid=487240997#gid=487240997" target="_blank">Lainkusanagi OSCP Like list of practice machines</a>, I completed all HTB, THM, & PG machines. You can see from my completed machine sheet that most machines I was lucky if I got a user or root level, warning the sheet contains spoilers, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XozpbDD511VevdUfauNfBcukAr9wWpmi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116720602911468126819&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">view my copy of the sheet here</a>.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">After purchasing the exam material, I at best skimmed through the important sections doing the occasional lab while skipping some sections entirely. HTB academy provided much better training material for a fraction of a cost of what OffSec provides. I recommend HTB academy modules AD attacker & enumeration, linux privilege escalation, and windows privilege escalation.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I enjoyed <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL08nYpWQJ_zM4JxekcckBVjglpVWgg2u0&si=IVGdr8Vx9DgO6zsB" target="_blank">Hack the Clown's GOAD Playlist.</a> & <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT08J44ErMmb9qaEeTYl5diQW6jWVHCR2&si=_WUtYPDNh95x9LzN" target="_blank">Derron C's AD playlist</a> for those who enjoy studying supplemental learning via video format from channels who are entertaining and not annoying.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I treated the OSCP-A,B,C challenge exams as if it were the actual exam, keeping track of my score and running the clock. The standalone machines were great practice machines and the AD machines all had good initial footholds. My main complaint about the practice challenge exams is that the jump from MS02 to DC01 was the same exact thing between all three practice sets, extremely lazy design from OffSec.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I tried some of the other challenge labs, secura was easily doable without hints, relia and medtech were so stupidly long and completely unconnected. I would not recommend that anyone waste their time with any challenge machines other than secura & OSCP-A,B,C.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">After receiving passing scores on all three challenge exams, I decided to finally schedule the exam for a few days out.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">Tools that I recommend learning are ligolo & penelope but even more important than learning tools is learning how to manually spot irregularities and anomalies.</p>


  <h2 id="exam-experience" style="margin-left: 15px;">Exam Experience</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">Can't talk about the exam too much, what I can say was I found the AD set to be extremely easy with the new assumed breach scenario, I flew through the set breaching it in 3-4 hours.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">One of my standalones was easy, the other was way harder than I expected (and not included anywhere in the OffSec training), and the last one I tried hours on with no initial foothold at all.</p>
  <img src="/assets/zl.png" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px"> 
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 10px">Total score was 80/100, I think I was a little lucky with a medium difficulty exam set, I was glad that I had completed enough machines & had taken good enough notes for the one standalone.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px"> No complains about exam stability as the VPN was stable and there were no technical issues. </p>
  


  <h2 id="exam-review" style="margin-left: 15px;">Exam Review</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px">Biggest complaint was how lazy the content creators were with OSCP-A,B,C copying and pasting the same exact scenario from MS02 to DC01, words cannot describe how pathetic this is.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: -10px">I must say that it was a huge relief to pass the first time and be done with the exam. Hopefully completing this will land me good roles in the future.</p>
